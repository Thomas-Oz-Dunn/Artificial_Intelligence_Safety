This is a Brainstorm Page.
Thoughts in here are not final.

Notes on gameplan===================================================================================================
Agency MUST have teeth, not just advice or ideals. 
For ethics to be actualized, there must be legal and professional consequences for those who violate code of conduct.
Like in the field of medicine or cars, medicine or cars or AI arn't EVIL to be destroyed, regulatory agency is just needed to ensure privacy, safety, and security. 
Reach out to authors of the respective sources for help and support.
Bring in a multidisciplinary team to take into account software, legal, political, economic, and philosophical ramifications.
Contact senators and representatives to get bill into Congress in collaboration with the White House.
There were cars before NHSTA mandated seatbelts, even when Detroit new seat belts saved more lives. Planes before the FAA. Sawdust bread before FDA.

Risk factor==========================================================================================
This idea can be seen as a threat to the most powerful organizations in human history.
With the largest accumulations of wealth, knowledge about the world, strategic leadership, and computatial power ever consolidated. 
From Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the Pentagon, many will try to oppose, but remember you have Allies.
Their influence over the economy, media, and policy is formidable. 
Be careful, strategic, and safe.

Notes on sources=======================================================================================================

National Science & Technology Council's advisory report on AI to then POTUS Obama in October 2016
	very knowledgeable, optimistic, but kicks the can of responsibility down the line, citing singularity not until 2030.
	Short term nature of the office fails to align long term risks with office holders.
	Good model for explaining machine learning to layman, as well as what AGI is.
	Recommendations should be referenced in proposal, very good framework, but needs teeth.

AI governance and ethics global perspectives 2019
	Austria's policy for becoming a data colony concerning for the fate of all similarly smaller states
	UK's uncertainty of post Brexit state leads to a lot of talk w/o action
	EU has made most progress, with committee established for monitoring industry, and red lines in wording
	Unclear how enforcable such demands are
	India, despite size and economic growth recently, remains framed as a data colony without privacy protections
	Look at Trump Administration Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in AI February 2019
	None have force of binding law yet.

AI Ethics - Too principled to Fail? Brent Mittelstadt brent.mittelstadt@aii.ox.ac.uk 2019
	Principles and values do not make actions necessarily ethical
	Field needs robust legal and professional accountability mechanisms
	Why to electricians and plumbers need licenses but not AI programmers?
	Unlike medicine, no common experiences, goals, values, or enforcement in the AI community
