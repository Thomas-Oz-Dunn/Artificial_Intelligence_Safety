Tom's notes on sources=======================================================================================================

National Science & Technology Council's advisory report on AI to then POTUS Obama in October 2016
	very knowledgeable, optimistic, but kicks the can of responsibility down the line, citing singularity not until 2030.
	Short term nature of the office fails to align long term risks with office holders.
	Good model for explaining machine learning to layman, as well as what AGI is.
	Recommendations should be referenced in proposal, very good framework, but needs teeth.

AI governance and ethics global perspectives 2019
	Austria's policy for becoming a data colony concerning for the fate of all similarly smaller states
	UK's uncertainty of post Brexit state leads to a lot of talk w/o action
	EU has made most progress, with committee established for monitoring industry, and red lines in wording
	Unclear how enforcable such demands are
	India, despite size and economic growth recently, remains framed as a data colony without privacy protections
	Look at Trump Administration Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in AI February 2019
	None have force of binding law yet.
