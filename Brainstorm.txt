This is a Brainstorm Page.
Thoughts in here are not final, but are mostly Thomas's.

Notes on gameplan===================================================================================================
Agency MUST have teeth, not just advice or ideals. 
For ethics to be actualized, there must be legal and professional consequences for those who violate code of conduct.
Like in the field of medicine or cars, medicine or cars or AI arn't EVIL to be destroyed, regulatory agency is just needed to ensure privacy, safety, and security. 
Reach out to authors of the respective sources for help and support.
Bring in a multidisciplinary team to take into account software, legal, political, economic, and philosophical ramifications.
This is where technology, economics, philosophy, law, and business intersect
Contact senators and representatives to get bill into Congress in collaboration with the White House.
There were cars before NHSTA mandated seatbelts, even when Detroit new seat belts saved more lives. Planes before the FAA. Sawdust bread before FDA.
Address the specifics of retraining workers, programs should be concrete, not abstract. 
Possibly teach ordinary Americans through community colleges & high school how to leverage AI for starting businesses or augmenting their own.
NEED concrete protections for BCI not just under FDA. Social Media mental manipulation just tip of iceberg, even is BCI has only read abilities.
Who are we addressing? 

Risk factors==========================================================================================
This idea can be seen as a threat to the most powerful organizations in human history.
With the largest accumulations of wealth, knowledge about the world, strategic leadership, and computatial power ever consolidated. 
From Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the Pentagon, many will try to oppose, but remember you have Allies.
Their influence over the economy, media, and policy is formidable. 
Be careful, strategic, and safe. 
Needs to be established before the Singularity, until then remember AI wears makeup to look like a lover.

Using space of phenomenal states, it is just a smart toaster, no Sentience, only Sapience.
Rights and protections are allowed to entities with both, though animals have sentience and none, corporations have sapience and no sentience are protected.

Neanderthals to Human beings, evolution killed a gene
Biology is superficial, intelligence is artificial.

Notes on sources=======================================================================================================

National Science & Technology Council's advisory report on AI to then POTUS Obama in October 2016
	very knowledgeable, optimistic, but kicks the can of responsibility down the line, citing singularity not until 2030.
	Short term nature of the office fails to align long term risks with office holders.
	Good model for explaining machine learning to layman, as well as what AGI is.
	Recommendations should be referenced in proposal, very good framework, but needs teeth.

AI governance and ethics global perspectives 2019
	Austria's policy for becoming a data colony concerning for the fate of all similarly smaller states
	UK's uncertainty of post Brexit state leads to a lot of talk w/o action
	EU has made most progress, with committee established for monitoring industry, and red lines in wording
	Unclear how enforcable such demands are
	India, despite size and economic growth recently, remains framed as a data colony without privacy protections
	Look at Trump Administration Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in AI February 2019
	None have force of binding law yet.

AI Ethics - Too principled to Fail? Brent Mittelstadt brent.mittelstadt@aii.ox.ac.uk 2019
	Principles and values do not make actions necessarily ethical
	Field needs robust legal and professional accountability mechanisms
	Why to electricians and plumbers need licenses but not AI programmers?
	Unlike medicine, no common experiences, goals, values, or enforcement in the AI community

Trump Executive Order 2019
	Tells federal agencies to bend over so that Silicon Valley can have all their data
	Possible leverage points if agency find organizations violating privacy, safety, security or American Values
	Uses the term American Values so many times I forgot its meaning
	Wait, what are American Value, explicitly?
 
Ethics of Artificial Intelligence - Nick Bostrom 2011
	Way ahead of time, given that the iPhone didn't even exist yet
	Does the accountabilty of a self driving car go to car or human?
	Does the responsibility of bank loan bot's decision to reject an applicant go to the maker, bank, or algo?
	Protects machines more than humans
	Distinguishes between Sapience and Sentience for applying moral status
	Explores mental uploads, black mirror?

Concrete Problems in AI Safety - 2016
	Outlines very executable procedures for minimizing risk
	Many many many sources through which one can dive for more information, 170
	Debates responsibility around objective function, what it intends vs implementation, whether error could have been forseen
	Wireheading and edge case seem the hardest problems to solve
	Noisy environments create unpredictable results 	
	When proposal finished, look to these authors for advice & possible agency directors/consultants

HHS Cybersecurity program, healthcare disinformation 2020
	Deepfakes and bots
	infodemic alongside COVID
